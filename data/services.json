{"services":[{"title":"Bedbugs","image":"/src/links/bedbug.jpg","description":"Our treatment process consists of insecticide, traps and steam.\n\n* Insecticide plays an important but limited role in treatment. Bedbugs have developed a resistance to insecticide, therefore it is important to use small amounts that are strategically placed.\n* Traps are a valuable tool in the treatment process. The trap we find most effective is a simple trap that is placed under each leg of the bed frame. In addition to isolating the bed, these traps catch bedbugs that could be hiding in places away from the bed.\n* The main focus of our treatment is the use of steam. Although time consuming, steam is the most effective way to eliminate all stages of a bedbug infestation.\n\nThree treatments is the average needed to eliminate an infestation. Depending on the severity of the infestation there may be additional treatments required."},{"title":"Insect and Rodent Control","image":"/src/links/ant-hill.jpg","description":"​When extra help is required, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) through Certified Pest Control offers reliable and predictable control of nuisance and/or damaging pests.
